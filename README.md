# Hello-World
Test run for jdconeonlymadejewelry blob and e-commerce website.
I am learning the steps it takes to become a graphic designer with a programmers' background.
I still have many years of study to go. I started out learning computer support(two year program)
on how to build, diagnose, and repair computers and laptops along with all the components they comprise. 
I have started learning the software side such as: html, css, javascript , jquery, php, mysql.
I happen to run across GitHub and here I am.
